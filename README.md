# range-ring-master-vba
Excel-VBA tool to export a Gibson Ridge placefile based on a list of sites with latitude/longitude.

Range Ring Master was developed from a tool called Range Ring Creator (which I also authored), which did nothing more than plot a circle 
of selectable radius - in nautical miles - around a desired latitude and longitude.  It was useful, but cumbersome because it involved a 
lot of copy/paste work to make the necessary changes to the placefiles.

When I started learning more about automation in scripting, and VBA's ability to create and export to text files, I figured the best 
thing to do would be to upgrade the old Creator to a form that could deal with multiple coordinate pairs at once, and output them all in 
a readable format without the user needing to understand how the placefiles are actually made.  As a result, a large file (at the time 
I'm writing this, ours holds 144 sites) can be administered with a little typing and a single click - additions, deletions, changes, all 
in the space of seconds instead of hours spent combing through to find all the individual things to change.

The goal of my work has always been to make tedious and difficult things faster and easier, in order to save time for matters of actual 
importance.  I hope that this will serve not only my own purposes, but those of others.

With this in mind, RRM is licensed under the Unlicense.  Do with it as you will, and enjoy.
