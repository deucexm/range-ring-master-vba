Range Ring Master changelog
last updated 2016-06-25 0023L

Overview: Range Ring Master (hereafter 'RRM') outputs a complete Gibson-Ridge placefile based on input data.
For TAF and RegionX groups, it takes the lat/long and plots a 120-sided polygon at ranges of 5 and 10 NM.
Irregular shapes and lines are handled by using text saved in columns on one of the worksheets.

TODO
- More error handling

1.2
- cUsedArrays set to nothing at end
- aRegionX/aTAFs nuked, used collection instead after appending region/TAF as index 0 for each
- Unnecessary declarations removed (sOtherX, aOtherX, etc.)
- Checks for empty site database before FileSystemObject is opened
- Site names now created by iterating through cUsedArrays
- Current version and github repository link added to top of code module
- OFF{} functions removed, WriteCircle formula adjusted to compensate for 0.4% horizontal variation

1.1
- Added Regions 4 through 6
- Region strings now built based off cell contents instead of static values
- User now warned if chosen filename exists and is asked whether to continue
- Set Option Explicit
- Renamed DBLegacy sheet -> DBLiteral
- Condensed code via iteration over the region arrays with cUsedArrays collection
- Avoided some iteration via Array = Range(), but created 2D arrays in the process; not sure of the optimal solution here

1.0
- Initial release
